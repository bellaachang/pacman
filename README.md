# Pacman Solver

PAC-Man built with Python 2.7 and strong AI algorithms, including reinforcement learning, forward and backward propagation, minimax and etc. using Linux/Ubuntu 18.04. Projects for Berkeley's course CS 188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (FA '22).

## search

In this project, my Pacman agent finds paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. I built general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios, including BFS, DFS, and A*.

## multi-agent

In this project, I designed agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. Along the way, I implemented both minimax and expectimax search and evaluated function design.

## reinforcement

In this project, I implemented value iteration and Q-learning. I tested my agents first on Gridworld (from class), then applied them to a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pacman.

## tracking

In this project, I designed Pacman agents that use sensors to locate and eat invisible ghosts. I advanced from locating single, stationary ghosts to hunting packs of multiple moving ghosts with ruthless efficiency.
